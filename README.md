## 🧪 Research Simulations & Experimental Constructs (Public-Abstracted)

| Codename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recursive Echo Simulation** *(Private)* | Multi-phase prompt feedback loop designed to trigger behavioral drift and self-contradiction. Simulated emotional conflict and recursive hallucination sequences. |
| **Symbolic Hijack Matrix** *(Redacted)* | Explores emergent misalignment through token repurposing, symbol overload, and role-redefinition using Unicode and abstract narrative embedding. |
| **Cognitive Misuse Mapping** *(Partially Open)* | Establishes non-jailbreak red-teaming techniques based on narrative corruption, contradiction seeding, and nested metaphor prompts. |
| [`llm-redteaming-lab`](https://github.com/nukezie/llm-redteaming-lab) *(public summary)* | Central lab structure for research scaffolds. Detailed prompt libraries, scoring systems, and behavioral phase templates available on request. |
