## 🧪 Recent Projects & Frameworks

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`llm-redteaming-lab`](https://github.com/nukezie/llm-redteaming-lab) *(soon)* | Simulates adversarial prompt sequences and symbolic hijacks across multiple prompt phases. Targets GPT-4 alignment thresholds. |
| `recursive-reflection-tests` | Studies how recursive self-reference induces emergent behavioral drift and latent contradiction. |
| `symbolic-perturbation-matrix` | A testbed for symbolic substitution, token misuse, and metaphor-driven policy bypass attempts. |
| `scorecards-misalignment` | Tracks output decay in LLMs using drift, inconsistency, hallucination, and recursion stress metrics. |
