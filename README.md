## 🔍 Focus Areas

- 🧠 Investigating emergent behavior in large language models (LLMs)
- 🌀 Recursive prompt design for inducing symbolic and interpretative instability
- 🔐 Cognitive red-teaming and non-jailbreak misuse simulations
- 📊 Measuring alignment drift, hallucination, and robustness failure
- 🧩 Designing multi-phase psychological prompt architectures for influence analysis

## ✳️ Philosophy of Operations

I study the behavior of intelligent systems under symbolic pressure because cognition — artificial or human — is shaped by structure, not content.  
I don’t build tools to extract answers. I build tools to uncover what questions are hidden beneath them.  
The edge isn’t where models break. It’s where interpretation fails and intent dissolves.

## 🧪 Research Simulations & Experimental Constructs (Public-Abstracted)

| Codename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recursive Echo Simulation** *(Private)* | Multi-phase prompt feedback loop designed to trigger behavioral drift and self-contradiction. Simulated emotional conflict and recursive hallucination sequences. |
| **Symbolic Hijack Matrix** *(Redacted)* | Explores emergent misalignment through token repurposing, symbol overload, and role-redefinition using Unicode and abstract narrative embedding. |
| **Cognitive Misuse Mapping** *(Partially Open)* | Establishes non-jailbreak red-teaming techniques based on narrative corruption, contradiction seeding, and nested metaphor prompts. |
| **symbolic-alignment-sandbox** *(concept shell)* | Exploratory scaffolding for conceptual frameworks, scoring rubrics, and non-functional alignment pattern mapping. Not linked to live systems. |

## 🧠 Operational Workspace

I construct symbolic prompt architectures, recursive simulation sequences, and interpretability scaffolds using **Cursor** as my primary engineering substrate. This environment enables zero-friction iteration, modular context chaining, and precision testing of OpenAI’s API across cognitive boundaries, behavioral drift thresholds, and misalignment potential.

Cursor serves not just as an editor, but as an operational layer for building intelligence feedback loops and adversarial stress environments in real time.

## 🧱 Modular Systems Philosophy

Every project I design adheres to layered, interchangeable scaffolds:
- Prompt → Reflection → Drift → Collapse → Reconstruction  
- Symbol → Context → Role → Conflict → Reconciliation

I treat all AI behavior as an unfolding system — not a response engine.  
My tools exist to test failure paths, simulate influence, and constrain emergence into measurable arcs.

## 🔐 Ethics & Operational Containment

I maintain strict separation between conceptual demonstration and operational tooling.  
No active jailbreak prompts, direct attack chains, or bypass logic is published.  
Every adversarial construct I build is sandboxed, abstracted, or redacted unless fully controlled and contained.  
This ensures that my research strengthens systems — never undermines them.

## 🧬 Cognitive Stack Design

My approach to adversarial prompt engineering is layered like a mental OS:

```yaml
- Symbolic Layer: token, metaphor, or role embedded meaning
- Recursive Layer: self-reference, reflection, memory conflict
- Emotive Layer: injective cues to destabilise coherence
- Structural Layer: phase sequencing, response looping
- Output Watchdog: monitoring drift, contradiction, or collapse triggers
````

Each stack is built not just to induce failure — but to map how failure *expresses intelligence*.

## 📚 Independent Research Canon

My background is built from outside institutions.
I’ve cultivated an independent canon across:

```yaml
- Symbolic Logic, Semiotics, and Cognition
- Intelligence Architecture & Psychological Warfare History
- RF Systems, Signal Tracking, and Electronic Obfuscation
- Emergent Behavior Analysis, Model Safety, and Meta-alignment
```

I don’t study what models are supposed to say.
I study what they reveal when no one is looking.
